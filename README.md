# ArduinoBLEAndroid
This project is aimed to training communication between arduino - android. The communication between them will be done with a sticky service which starts at boot and continuosly try to connect to a HM-10 BLE module.

The information received will be sended to a remote server via socket IO and also it will be able to send commands to arduino in order to switch on/off a light. The android app only will be a simple bridge between the arduino and a remote Telegram Bot.

Below the complete flowchart of the project:
